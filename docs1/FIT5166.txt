Your feedback to Us

Monash is committed to excellence in education and regularly seeks feedback from students, employers and staff. One of the key formal ways students have to provide feedback is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The University¡¯s student evaluation policy requires that every unit is evaluated each year. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the surveys. The feedback is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied and areas for improvement.

Assessment Tasks

Participation

Assessment task 1

Title:
Unit Test
Description:
Closed-book unit test to be conducted in the lecture time slot in Week 8.
Weighting:
20%
