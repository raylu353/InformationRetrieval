Your feedback to Us

Monash is committed to excellence in education and regularly seeks feedback from students, employers and staff. One of the key formal ways students have to provide feedback is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The University¡¯s student evaluation policy requires that every unit is evaluated each year. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the surveys. The feedback is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied and areas for improvement.

For more information on Monash¡¯s educational strategy, see:

www.monash.edu.au/about/monash-directions/ and on student evaluations, see: www.policy.monash.edu/policy-bank/academic/education/quality/student-evaluation-policy.html

Previous Student Evaluations of this Unit

The materials have been updated to reflect a strong relationship between lectures and tutorials. In past years (prior to 2011), the lectures and tutorials work were not well aligned.

Some changes to the materials were made in 2011 taking this feedback into consideration. Further changes include introducing another practical programming component well aligned with theory delivered in lectures around the area of mobile computing.
