Streamlined. Inside and out.
Designing a larger iPhone without making it feel bigger was no small task. It required challenging the idea of ��big��. It called for narrowing when the natural inclination was to expand. It meant condensing powerful technologies and making chips smaller and batteries thinner, all while making them more capable. And it meant engineering our thinnest, most advanced Multi?Touch display. All of which yields a dramatically thin design.

Everything within reach.
By creating iPhone 6 and iOS 8 together, we optimised the software to enhance the physical design. iOS swipe gestures were designed to be more fluid across the seamless form, making it easy to navigate iPhone with one hand. With new features like Reachability, you can interact with the larger screen in different ways too. Simply double-touch the Home button and the entire screen shifts down closer to your thumb. And to easily navigate Safari or Mail, swipe left to right across the screen to go backward, or swipe right to left to go forward. With the new continuous surface of iPhone, all your gestures now feel smoother than ever.

We also thought about how you use your iPhone every day and redesigned the buttons to make it even easier to use. Elongated volume buttons are integrated into the thinner profile, outlined to make them effortless to find by touch. And the Sleep/Wake button has a new home on the side of the device to put it comfortably within reach. The result is an experience that��s even more intuitive.

The elements of beautiful design.
To create a larger iPhone that��s extraordinarily light, we pioneered new display technologies. We carefully selected every material. Each detail was meticulously designed, engineered and crafted until iPhone had an incredibly thin, continuous form. From the anodised aluminium and stainless steel to the curve of the polished glass, iPhone 6 is worth its weight in gold, silver and space grey.
