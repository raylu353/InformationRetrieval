Terms and Conditions of Sale
These Customer Terms and Conditions ("Terms") set out the terms and conditions relating to the use of our website at www.samsung.com/au/estore/ (our "Site") and the contract between us for the sale of products ("Contract") via the area on the Site where we sell products (the "Online Store"). The Terms do not cover the sale of our products by third parties to you.

In order to use the Site, including the Online Store, you must first agree to the Terms. You must not use the Site and may not accept the Terms if you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Samsung. 

Please read the Terms carefully and understand them, before ordering any products through our Site ("Products"). You should understand that by ordering any of our Products, you accept the Terms. You may print a copy of the Terms for future reference.

We reserve the right to amend the Terms from time to time. Whenever you wish to use the Site, please check the Terms to ensure you understand the terms which will apply at that time. The Terms were most recently updated on 3 June 2014.

1. Information about us
In the Terms, "we", "us", "our" or "Samsung" means Samsung Electronics Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 002 915 648), a company registered in Australia with our registered office at Quad Samsung, 8 Parkview Drive, Homebush Bay, NSW 2127. We operate the Site in accordance with the Terms.

2. Products
2.1 Any images or photographs of the Products that we put on our Site are for illustration only and actual Products available for purchase in Australia may differ from that shown. We use reasonable endeavours to make sure the colours, sizes and details are displayed accurately but errors may occur. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the way in which your computer displays these colours or details accurately reflects the Products made available by us. The Products you receive may therefore vary slightly from those advertised.

2.2 Any packaging that we use to provide the Products to you may vary from any packaging indicated on our Site (where applicable).

3. Orders for Products
3.1 Our order process will permit you to check the Products you have ordered and amend any errors before submitting the order. Please ensure that you read through your order before submitting it.

3.2 Your order constitutes an offer by you to buy our Products on the Terms. You are deemed to have placed an order with us by ordering via our online checkout process. After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order and containing an order reference number and details of the Product(s) you have ordered ("Order Confirmation"). Please note that the Order Confirmation is acknowledgment that we have received your order and does not mean your order has been accepted by us. All orders are subject to our acceptance of your offer to buy the Product(s) ordered. We will only accept your offer (and form the contract of sale) when we send you an email confirming that the Product has been dispatched (a "Dispatch Confirmation"). The Terms constitute the entire Contract between us and you for the supply of Products.

3.3 We may refuse to accept your order: 
3.3.1 where the Product is not available;
3.3.2 where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment;
3.3.3 if there has been a pricing or Product description error (see clause 3.6 below); or
3.3.4 if you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out in clause 5 below.
3.4 The Contract will only be formed when we send you an email from no-reply@store.samsung.com that contains the Dispatch Confirmation. The parties to the Contract are you and Samsung Electronics Australia Pty Ltd ACN 002 915 648.

3.5 The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation.

3.6 All our Products are subject to availability. If, for any reason, any or all of the Products you have ordered are or become unavailable or there has been an error in the price on our site or the Online Store we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of this as soon as possible after becoming aware of it and advise you of the revised delivery dates. In such cases, if you have already paid for the Products we will either notify you when the Products will be delivered or refund you the amount paid as soon as reasonably possible.

You may be entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You may also be entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.

7.4 If you meet the requirements of clause 7.2 you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Product in accordance with our Returns Policy (see clause 11 below).

7.5 To cancel the Contract, you should contact us by telephoning the Customer Call Centre (http://www.samsung.com/au/info/contactus.html).

8. Availability and delivery
8.1 We can deliver anywhere in Australia.

8.2 We offer you a choice of delivery methods by Australia Post parcel post or by express parcel post (depending on your location within Australia) and your chosen delivery method will be specified on the Dispatch Confirmation. All deliveries will receive a delivery tracking number which will be specified on the Dispatch Confirmation, you will also receive SMS confirmation of your tracking number if you elect to include a valid Australian mobile number during checkout. The tracking number allows you to track the progress of your order by visiting the delivery partner's website and following the prompts to input your tracking number.

8.3 The date of dispatch listed on the Dispatch Confirmation is the estimated date of dispatch as is reasonably estimated by us.

8.4 We will deliver the Products to the delivery address you specify in your order. We will not deliver the Products to your delivery address unless there is someone present to accept and sign for them, during normal business houses (9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday). If there is not someone present at your delivery address to sign for and take delivery of the Products, a parcel collection card will be left at your delivery address and the Products will be delivered to your local Australia Post Office for your collection. If you have not received the Product(s) or a parcel collection card within the estimated delivery time specified in the Dispatch Confirmation you should contact us via our website, by email or by telephoning the Customer Call Centre (http://www.samsung.com/au/info/contactus.html).

10. Price and payment
10.1 The price of the Products will be as quoted on our Site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Product prices include GST at the current rates. Unless specified otherwise, the price quoted on our Site for Products includes delivery charges.

10.2 Product prices and delivery charges are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation.

10.3 Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product��s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you that we are rejecting it. If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an error, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price.

10.4 Payment for all Products must be made either by credit or debit card and is collected on our behalf by Global Collect. We accept payment by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and PayPal. A payment by credit or debit card will only be charged at or shortly after the time you place your order.

14.3 Subject to our obligations under the Non-Excludable Terms, nothing in these Terms shall render us liable to indemnify you in respect of any liability of any kind incurred by you to any other person but this is not an exclusion of any liability that may arise by virtue of a breach by us of the Terms or any negligence on our part or that of our employees or agents.
